									<h1>A little<br />
									more...</h1>
									<p>Over the years, I've always had a keen interest in technology. 
										During the COVID-19 lockdown, I began my small career in web-dev by designing my own e-commerce
										 site for sunglasses. 
										 Now, I work with Marlin Engineering, regularly operating and maintaining their database management systems, 
										 and designing web apps for the FDOT to use in their office.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My success in this industry is due to two key factors: my passion for creative design and my failures. Currently, I am working as a Transportation Data Systems Intern for a company called Marlin. At Marlin we create and maintain web-apps for the department of transportation to use in their offices. I’ve learned a lot working on these applications, and I would like to start shifting my career into that developmental field. In 2019, I also purchased a subscription to Shopify. I started reselling sunglasses online because I thought it was interesting. It was not long until I realized the potential of what began as an “informal business” and began putting many more hours into it. After seeing people online bring in so much more revenue than me, my failing store provided me with the motivation I needed to make it work. I designed my own website with a modern, sleek looking theme and added all the things necessary to make it a credible website for my consumers, like real product reviews, my company’s mission statement, and other smaller details. Although none of the actual products were in my possession, I was able to implement an automated bot from SaleHoo that would purchase the product from the third party and send it directly to my consumer. This bot made a lot of repetitive tasks tremendously easier, it worked with multiple different services and reduced hours of work on product research, pricing, and sales into a few clicks. It was an early project in my tech journey, but one that I am very proud of.</p>
								<p>My goal is to do freelance work where I can represent myself and ultimatley work for myself. I hope that one day I will have my name for myself in the industry through my skillsets. One that companies think of instantly when they are in need of a quality database or website design. </p>
